    Here comes a wave
    <br>
    Meant to wash me away
    <br>
    A tide that is taking me under
    <br>
    Swallowing sand
    <br>
    Left with nothing to say
    <br>
    My voice drowned out in the thunder
    </p>

    <p class="secondparagraph">
      But I won't cry
      <br>
      And I won't start to crumble
      <br>
      Whenever they try
      <br>
      To shut me or cut me down
      </p>

        I <span class="red">won't</span> be <span class="disappear"> silenced </span>
        <br>
        You can't keep me quiet
        <br>
        Won't tremble when you try it
        <br>
        All I know is I won't go speechless
        </p>
